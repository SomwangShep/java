        Source code is code that was typed by a programmer in a high level language like Java. The compiler reads this file, and creates a new file containing executable code that the computer can run. Once a program has been compiled into machine language, it will only run on a processor it was compiled for. A program normally has to be compiled for each type of computer it will run on.

		Java programs are compiled to run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM is an imaginary microprocessor with its own binary instruction set. When we compile our Java programs, they are converted to run on this imaginary processor. A compiled Java program is said to in bytecode format.
		When we run a Java program, the JVM converts the Java bytecode into machine language for computer on which it is will run.

		The JVM is part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The JRE is needed to run Java programs. The JRE contains the JVM and lots of compiled Java files. This software is free, but most operating systems include it so you don't need to install it. When your computer nags you about a Java update, it is trying to install the latest version of the JRE. Since virtually all computers have a JVM, Java programs are platform independent. A compiled Java program will run on any computer.

		To create new Java programs, a developer must install the Java Development Kit (JDK), which is also free and can be found at java.sun.com. There are three editions of the JDK; Java Micro Edition (J2ME), Java Standard Edition (J2SE), and Java Enterprise Edition (J2EE). We will be using the Standard Edition. The JDK is a development kit. Among other things, it contains a program that compiles Java source code.

The JDK includes the JRE, which includes the JVM.
